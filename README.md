# PyBer_Analysis
### The Purpose of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to separate the city-type data and then break down that data based on total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per driver, and fares per week. Breaking down this data allows the reader to better understand where the resources are being allocated and where success is the highest.

### Results

While there are exceptions, the directions of the slopes of the “Total Fare by City Types” graph are very similar throughout indicating that the more profitable seasons tend to be uniform throughout the different city types. This graph additionally illustrates which city types are more profitable, and the ranges for each city type. 

•	The urban city-type range lies around: $1,500 to $2,500

•	The suburban city type range lies around: $500 to $1,500

•	The rural city type range lies around: $0 to $500

The PyBer Summary shows that the average fare is most expensive for rural cities and least expensive for urban cities. The average fare per driver for rural cities is more than three times more expensive than that of urban drivers. However, the total fare for urban cities approaches ten times more than that of the rural total fares. The urban and suburban cities are more affordable for the consumer and more profitable. Between the two, the urban cities are far outperforming the suburban cities in both affordability and profit. 


### Based on the results it seems favorable to: 
1.	Work towards a continued expansion of resources in the urban cities. 

       o	Based on this data, it is most likely that the company will see its quickest and highest return by focusing on Urban cities. 

2.	Hire more rural drivers.

       o	Based on this data, there may not be enough rural drivers as the average fare per driver is significantly higher for rural drivers than the urban and suburban drivers. Proportionately, between total rides over total drivers, there are significantly fewer for rural 
drivers. This could be driving the average fare cost up and decreasing the number of rides.

3.	Record the distance of rides 

       o	When analyzing potential reasons for the ride cost, and the relationship between ride cost and quantity of rides per city, distance is an important factor. When analyzing this data it seems that the decrease in total fare per city type could be due to the lack of drivers, pushing up the price, and decreasing the demand. However, with further investigation, it could be determined if the increase in cost is due to distances traveled, or not. Either way, the data indicates, that the distance of rides could be used to increase the total rides for the rural and suburban areas.
